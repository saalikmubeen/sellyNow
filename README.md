 ## TODO

- [x] Make use of animations
- [ ] Adding Redux Toolkit: I started with redux, refactoring to redux toolkit would have just wasted time.
- [ ] Code in Typescript: Wasn't in a mood to define types about everything and get into type checking hell.
- [ ] Add unit testing: Not a fan testing tbh unless you are working in a team.
